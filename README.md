# ðŸ“„ PDF Question Answering Chatbot using LangChain & Hugging Face

An intelligent **PDF Q&A Chatbot** built using **Flask**, **LangChain**, and **Hugging Face Transformers**.  
This application allows users to upload a PDF, process its content, and ask natural language questions â€” getting accurate answers generated by a language model trained for reasoning and comprehension.

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… **PDF Upload:** Upload any PDF file to extract and process its text.  
âœ… **Smart Chunking:** Splits large documents into manageable sections using LangChainâ€™s text splitter.  
âœ… **Contextual Search:** Uses **FAISS vector store** for fast and accurate similarity-based retrieval.  
âœ… **AI Answering:** Answers are generated using the **Google FLAN-T5** model from Hugging Face.  
âœ… **Interactive Web UI:** Built with **Flask**, **HTML**, and **CSS** for a smooth user experience.  
âœ… **Ngrok Integration:** Easily host your local Flask app with a public URL.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Upload a PDF file** â†’ The system extracts all text using `PyPDF2`.  
2. **Text Splitting** â†’ The content is split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.  
3. **Embeddings Creation** â†’ Each chunk is converted into vectors using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.  
4. **Vector Storage** â†’ FAISS stores these embeddings for fast semantic search.  
5. **Ask a Question** â†’ When you type a question, the app finds the most relevant chunks.  
6. **Answer Generation** â†’ The **FLAN-T5** model generates a precise, context-aware answer.
